	Every time na magddownload ako ng file, hindi ko na po naaayos, and for the time being, nagbbuild-up yung mga files sa 
download folder causing to a "messy" download folder. But, what if we create a python program that will do the file management for us?
That is where na naisip ko, pwede kaya yun?
	I searched the internet and I found this YouTube video "Start Automating Your Life Using Python! (File Management with Python Tutorial)"
by Internet Made Coder [link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCvI-K0Gp90]
	In the program i used several modules to access, modify and move files from my download folder to another. The program will detect 
every file downloads na mapupunta sa download folder and as a result, malilipat nya ito to its respective folders (images, videos, music and documents)
In every type of file, I implemented several formats. If the program detected/read the format it will move the file into another folder. 
Every time na maggdodownload ako, as long as it is an image, video, audio or documents, the program will the the file management for me.
	Basically, that's how my program works and I found it interesting because it somehow solved my problem about file management in my 
download folder
